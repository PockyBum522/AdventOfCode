## AoC-2022-Cpp

Doing Advent of Code 2022 in C++ because why not. (I haven't touched C++ in many years.)

Since I'm learning C++ as I go, structure and technique should not be judged as anything more than a learning exercise. It will, undoubtedly, improve by the end of AoC 2022.

I will be copying each day's solution over to the next day, and then deleting the specific code for the previous day. As I progress through AoC 2022, I will likely end up with helpful utility code.

### AoC-2022-Cpp Notes

* Day 05 solutions labelled (with crane) are well worth running yourself, but can be seen at:
    (WARNING, SPOILER: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3-i1RZmPVg)

* Day 07 is not well organized, but I learned a lot.

* Day 08 is well organized, I'm happy with that code, even though it's simple.

* Day 09 is well organized and more object-oriented.
